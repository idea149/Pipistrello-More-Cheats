# Mod adding more cheats to Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo's cheat menu.

## Added cheats
|  |  |
| ---- | -------------|
| Change Equips | Change badges anywhere. Use the top face button to get/upgrade/remove badges |
| List Objects | List all objects displayed on screen |
| Save State: Load | Load save state created by Save State: Perform |
| Spawn Battery | Spawns a battery at the player's position |
| Spawn Key | Spawns a Key at the player's position |
| Spawn Laser | Spawns a Laser Cannon at the player's position |

The cheat menu can be activated by holding SELECT + top face button + RIGHT BUMPER. Once activated, hold SELECT and press the top face button to open the menu.

Notes:
- Leaving then entering a room with a spawned item will cause an error message to appear. This is likely due to the object not having valid id in the map.json
- Lasers do not have the correct collision

## Installation
1. Download the [Melon Loader Installer](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/releases/) and follow its instructions.
2. Launch Pipistrello. If Melon Loader was correctly installed, a terminal window should open along with the game.
3. Open Pipistrello's install directory (Can be found by right clicking the game in steam > Manage > Browse Local Files). There should be a Mods folder.
4. Drag the More_Cheats.dll into the mods folder.
